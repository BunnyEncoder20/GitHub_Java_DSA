Java 
-------------------
JVM + libraries = JRE
JRE + Development tools = JDK
where : 
    JVM = java virtual machine 
    JRE = Java Runtime Environment 
    JDK = Java development kit

A java source code (.java) can be converted into byte code (.class) 
using the Java compiler. 
Byte code can then be run on any machine as long as it has a JRE
(eg: code written in windows can be runned on linux, Mac, etc)

In any other machine, The JVM can then convert that byte code 
into native code 

Class is a large entity in Java, which can house many fucntions
(Class = kitchen and functions = utencils ...maybe ...idk)
